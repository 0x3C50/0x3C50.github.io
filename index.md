## Hello there!
I am 0x150. You may know me from some DuperTrooper videos, or from the famous minecraft trolling group "Moles", which often gets referenced in the Minecraft server hosting provider's discord of "Minehut".

I do infosec and a lot of minecraft development. I know my way around java and the fabric modding api pretty well, and picked up some skills in infosec along my journey. This blog contains all the interesting stuff I found over my journey, and will be updated with all the new stuff I find aswell.

I hope you enjoy!
